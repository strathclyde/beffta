### minimum required

In an excel woorkbook, query Bloomberg for historical (bdh) as well as contemporaneous (bdp) data for a market index as well as a broad cross-section of U.S. stocks. Historical data should be retrieved from October 1^st^ 2016 to today at the daily frequency on individual ticker specific sheets (one sheet per name). All names' contemporaneous data, on the other hand, should sit on a single sheet. The Bloomberg ticker for the market index is 'RAY Index' while those for the corporation names are listed below:

BBG stock tickers |                 |                 |                 |

The historical time series should include the following market & book data fields:

field                 | Bloomberg symbol                       
----------------------|-----------------
close price           | PX_LAST
book value per share  | BOOK_VAL_PER_SH
earnings per share    | TRAIL_12M_EPS
dividend per share    | TRAIL_12M_DVD_PER_SH
debt                  | SHORT_AND_LONG_TERM_DEBT
equity                | TOTAL_EQUITY
current assets        | BS_CUR_ASSET_REPORT
current liabilities   | BS_CUR_LIAB
sales                 | SALES_REV_TURN

Contemporaneous data on the other hand should include the number of shares outstanding, number of directors on the board, number of women on the board, number of board meetings per year, long company name and companie description. Explore Bloomberg to find the corresponding field symbols.


### going further

* Using VBA, make your workbook updatable. Ammend your workbook so that it retrieves up to date data in one clic.
  + Hint 1. Update doesn't necessarily mean adding most recent values to an existing time series. Requerying the whole data up to the most recent date would work as well.
  + Hint 2. Inspect the BQL syntax in Bloomberg formula cells, ammend accordingly.

* Using VBA, make your workbook flexible. Ammend your workbook so that it can retrieve data for any set of stocks/indexes & market/book fields at various frequencies (year, month, week, day), from and to any date.
  + Hint 1. Object oriented programming could help; excel table objects in particular.
  + Hint 2. Create an update sheet with tickers list, parameters (frequency, start and end dates) and fields. This sheet could also be use to host the contemporaneous dataset.

* Using VBA, make your workbook fully portable. If you open your workbook without a live Bloomberg connection you'll notice you loose the contemporaneous dataset; try to fix that problem somehow. 
  + Hint 1. VBA events could help.
  

You now have a fully customizable & portable tool to retrieve financial data from Bloomberg and now it's time to use it.



## Load

```{r, include = FALSE}
library(readxl); library(dplyr); library(data.table)

path <- 'data-raw/pullit.xlsm'; ticker_market <- 'RAY Index'; window <- 252L

ticker_firms <- read_excel(path, sheet = "update", range = cell_cols("D")) %>% filter(ticker != ticker_market)

static <- read_excel(path, sheet = "update", range = cell_cols("D:H")) %>% 
  filter(ticker != ticker_market) %>% mutate_at(vars(-ticker), funs(as.numeric))

tickers <- gsub(pattern = '/', replacement = '~', x = c(ticker_market, ticker_firms$ticker))

historical <- lapply(tickers, function(x) read_excel(path, sheet = x, skip = 1L) %>% 
                       mutate(Date = as.Date(Date), ticker = x) %>% 
                       mutate_at(vars(-c('ticker', 'Date')), funs(as.numeric)) %>% 
                       filter(! is.na(Date))) %>% 
  rbindlist()
```

In R or Python (examplesolutions will be provided for both programming languages), load the workbook data in memory. Organise the data in two dataframes, one for the historical times series, the other for static (contemporaneous) data. The time series dataframe should have a two-level row index including tickers & dates while columns should host the corresponding time series; the dataframe structure should look as follow:

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
as_tibble(select(historical, ticker, everything()))
```

The static dataset on the other hand should be row-indexed by tickers and have columns hosting the corresponding static fields; the dataframe structure should look as follow:

```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
as_tibble(static)
```
